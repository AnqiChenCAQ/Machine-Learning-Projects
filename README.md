# Machine-Learning-Projects
Explorations of fundamental machine learning concepts and techniques

Part I. Data Analysis and Visualization (Models used: Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regerssion, Support Vector Machine, K-Means Clustering; Tools used: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, StatsModels, seaborn, missingno, Matplotlib.)

1. Wine Quality Prediction:
Predict Portuguese white Vinho Verde wines' quality based on 11 physiochemical and sensory variables by running a multilinear regression model on 4898 samples. 

2. Bike Sharing Demand Prediction:
Predict Capital Bikeshare's count of rents based on 14 independent variables using random forest regression model on data of a whole year.

3. Heart Disease Prediction: 
Predict the presence of heart disease in the patient with 14 attributes using support vector machine on data from three hospital systems.
        
4. Poker Hand Prediction:
Predict the Poker Hand of 5 cards drawn from a standard deck of 52 with K-Means Clustering.
